## I. Introduction

The quest to design and develop new functional and structural materials for various technological applications lies at the heart of materials discovery that motivates the researchers and engineers to study more about the properties of material interfaces.
Most of the engineering materials are polycrystalline in nature, and the interface between the two grains with relative misorientation is called the grain boundary(GB) interface.
It is a well known fact that structure and properties of these interfaces have a significant influence in the material properties.
For example, even the presence of a single grain boundary in a single crystalline turbine blade makes it unsuitable to witness the high temperature creep [(Kim2017)](Kim2017).
These interfaces are considered as 2D material defects that significantly influence several important properties such as electrical, magnetic, mechanical and optical properties.
Engineering these boundary interfaces in order to obtain the desired material property is the subject of the new discipline of Material Science and Engineering called “Grain Boundary Engineering”.
Grain boundary (GB) features have a critical role in determining and predicting the material behaviour, particularly in semiconducting materials and ceramics~\citep{}.
Interfaces in materials are a large issue; if a single crystal research is excluded, the rest of the discipline of metallurgy and material science includes the interfacial characteristics ~\citep{Hickman2020}.

One of the most important properties that are dramatically influenced by these GBs are electrical and thermal conductivity.
We could consider GBs as a network of thermal resistors that are inserted in series and parallel with the conducting grains.
The scattering of phonons at the boundary interface is the primary reason for this interfacial thermal resistance.
The mechanism of heat conduction is similar to that of sound in solids, and hence phonons could also be considered as a particle of heat that traverses across the  solid medium.
In general, phonons with high acoustic frequency contribute to the heat conduction and the scattering is due to the acoustic impedance mismatch between the two grains.
The GB thermal resistance is also referred to as GB Kapitza resistance in the literature as this boundary resistance phenomenon was first investigated by Russian scientist Peter L. Kapitza in 1941 between the solid and liquid helium interface~\citep{Kapitza1941}.

Nowadays, electronics based on plastic substrates are becoming more popular in the emerging IoT devices because of their lightweight and cost-effectiveness [4-6].
The key to improve the flexible electronics is to fabricate integrated circuits (ICs) on plastic substrates.
Because of its excellent carrier mobility and compatibility, Si has been considered as a leading choice for future conventional electronic devices.
Many strategies for synthesizing Si and Si based polycrystalline materials at ambient condition on plastic/glass substrates have been investigated in recent years [7, 8].
And also our understanding of material interfaces in recent years has significantly improved because of the more advanced research tools such as EBSD/SEM which aids the development of such functional materials.
It is evident that the studies on material interfaces have the potential to answer many of the fundamental questions in the field.
This attracts the interest of many researchers in the scientific community to study the structure and properties of GB interfaces.

In this work we intend to systematically study the symmetric tilt GBs in Si with <001> misorientation axis using classical molecular dynamics(MD) simulations.
Silicon is one of the most suitable materials to study the phonon thermal conductivity using MD simulations, since the thermal conduction in semiconducting material is mostly dominated by atomic vibrations unlike electrons in metals.
