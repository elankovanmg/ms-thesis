## IV. SUMMARY

Using SW and MOD-TF potentials, we predicted the atomic structures of ten STGBs with <001> misorientation axes in Si.
The GB defect energy was also calculated and plotted as a function of tilt angle.
Later, we estimated the Kapitza conductance of these GBs using NEMD technique.
We could observe a correlation between the structural units(SUs), defect energy and Kapitza resistance of these interfaces.
Furthermore, we compare our findings to the recently published work~\cite{Hickman2020}.

On careful analysis, below were the novel predictions of this work:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Classical SW potential was able to predict the atomic structures of the GB interfaces like MOD-TF potential. Both these models reveals a repeating atomic structural patters. In some interfaces the SUs were same and in some cases the structures has dissimilar atomic environments.
\item  All the GBs reveals the 5-atom rings, few with the combination of 3-5-atomic rings or 3-6-atomic rings (also referred as Kite-like SUs).
\item  Exact same structural units predicted by both these models, does not necessarily has the same defect energy. We observe a constant offset in GB energy between the SW and MOF-TF potential. When the SUs are same, the defect energy calculated from SW potentials is higher.
\item  The interatomic potential plays a significant role especially for GBs with a small disorientation angle. i.e, LA and HA GBs. Example Σ401(20 1 0)[$\theta$ =5.73] and Σ181(10 9 0)[$\theta$=83.97] have different SUs and also the Kapitza conductance values estimated by SW potential are roughly 3 times higher than the MOD-TF model. When these GBs are compared with intermediate angles we observe more sophisticated structures at the boundary.
\item  We find that all the GB structures with misorientation angles ranging from 13.44° to 70.53°, including equilibrated and intermediate states, can be well described by a collection of 5-atom ring arrangements alone, the GB energy and the conductivity of these GBs remains nearly constant, agreeing well with the recent MD results on Si GBs ~\cite{Hickman2020}. These GBs have high energies and estimate the similar Kapitza conductance values.
\item  High angle GBs with a misorientation angle of greater than 80° have the same conductivity values and appear to be defect-free.
\item  In contrast, Σ5(3 1 0)[$\theta$=36.87] singular GBs which have densely packed 5-atom right shows the lower thermal conductivity among the GBs studied.
\item This indeed, reveals that when the 5-atom rings are further apart the interface has high conductivity and when these 5-atom rings are closer the conductivity drops. This could be gradually observed when we compare the SUs from Σ401(20 1 0)[$\theta$=5.73°] to Σ5(3 1 0)[$\theta$=36.87°] GBs.
\item  With decreasing grain boundary energy (i.e., with increasing structural disorder at the grain boundary), the estimated Kapitza conductance of grain boundaries in silicon increases gradually.
\end{enumerate}

The SW and TF potentials both forecast GBs with a high angle, indicating energetically favourable GB structures with low GB energies.
This means that the fundamental variations between the two potentials have a big impact on the predicted GB characteristics, especially for low and high angle GBs.
As a result, while performing simulations with Si STGBs, it’s important to choose the right potential.
