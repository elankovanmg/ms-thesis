###Abstract

We studied the atomic structure, grain boundary energy and Kapitza conductance of Symmetrical Tilt Grain Boundaries(STGBs) in Silicon with $<001>$ misorientation axis using classical molecular dynamics simulations.
Kaptiza conductance of these GB interfaces was calculated using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics(NEMD) technique.
We also examine the corelation between the grain boundary energy and the Kaptiza conductance.
The GB system was modelled using Stillinger-Weber(SW) and recently optimized Tersoff potential(MOD-TF) to better understand the influence of the interatomic force field in predicting the atomic structures at the interface and itâ€™s thermal conductivity.
Both these models reveal the similar dislocation core structure with repeating patterns at the interface with a combination of kite-like structure and 5-atom rings when viewed along the tilt axis.
However, for low angle GB $\Sigma 401(20 1 0)[\theta = 5.73^o]$ and singular GB $\Sigma 5(3 1 0)[\theta = 36.87^o]$ there is a difference in the structural units(SUs) observed at the interface.
Kapitza conductance calculated using MOD-TF potential for low disorientation angles shows 3 times higher values than the SW case.
But GBs with intermediate angles has the similar value of Kapitza conductance in both these models, and has a linear correlation with GB energy.
Among the GBs studied, the singular GB $\Sigma 5(3 1 0)$ offers the highest resistance to the flow of thermal heat current and high angle GBs with tilt angle $\Sigma 85 \ (7 \ 6 \ 0)[81.50^o]$ and $\Sigma 181 \ (10 \ 9 \ 0)[83.97^o]$ has the lowest thermal resistance.
As the distance of separation between the SU increases the GB energy decreases and the Kapitza conductance increases.
We also find that, interatomic potential plays a significant role in predicting the atomic structures, defect energy and thermal conductivity of the GB interfaces.
